_use_case_1_:
input_1: "" | input_2: "" | output: "please enter a value in both fields!"
_use_case_2_:
input_1: "a" | input_2: "" | output: "please enter a value in both fields!"
_use_case_3_:
input_1: "" | input_2: "a" | output: "please enter a value in both fields!"
--description--:
an empty string or NULL value in either or both user input fields is the simplest way of checking error handling capabilities.

_use_case_4_:
input_1: "a" | input_2: "a" | output: "1"
--description--:
the string "a" is one of only two single-letter words in the English language making it
the simplest way to test this behavior.

_use_case_5_:
input_1: "a" | input_2: "a a" | output: "2"
--description--:
the string "a" is one of only two single-letter words in the English language making it the simplest way to test this behavior. the second input value "a a" allows us to test for multiple occurrences of input_1 in input_2 rather than simply testing for equivalency of the two inputs.

_no_match_use_cases_:
_use_case_6_:
input_1: "a" | input_2: "i" | output: "0"
--description--:
the string "a" is one of only two single-letter words in the English language, making it,
along with "i", the simplest way to test this behavior.

_use_case_7_:
input_1: "a" | input_2: "i i" | output: "0"
--description--:
the string "a" is one of only two single-letter words in the English language, making it,
along with "i", the simplest way to test this behavior. the second input value "i i" allows us test whether the data is being treated as a single string or as multiple words.
